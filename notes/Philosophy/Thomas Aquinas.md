- They treat the statement "God exists" as if it was a self-evident statement
- It can be self evident in itself, to us, or both
- If we don't know the meanings of the words of a sentence, then the sentence is not going to be self-evident to us 
- Gods existence is self-evident in itself but not to us
- Change is motion
- Changes from a state of potentiality to a state of actuality
- The fact that there is motion, there has to be an unmoved mover, there must a first mover
- God is what sets motion in place

## Four types of causes
- Material cause
	- Bronze
- Formal cause
	- Me (the form of the sculpture)
- Final cause
	- Purpose of the sculpture
- Effecient cause
	- Sculpter 

## Five Ways
1. Way of motion change
2. Way of efficient causality
3. Way of possibility/contigency and nessassity
	- Everything that just happens to just happen exist, at one time did not exist
	- If all that exists is contingent, it means at one time nothing would of existed
	- If there was a time where nothing existed, nothing would exist right now
	- First being is a being whose existence is nessarry
4. Way of excellence
	- One can be greater than another without an absolute standard of excellence
5. Way of harmony
	- Things that are mindless acting in harmony (planets resolving around the sun)
	- Everything has an apparent order
