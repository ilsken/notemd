  - Plato

- Seek rational explanations of the world
- Deals with the [Problem of the One vs Many][onevmany]

### Reason - Rationalism
- Very different from claims made from experience
- A priori (prior to experience)
- Any mathematical formula (you don't need to experience `2 + 2`)
- True out of necessity, the statement is always true 
- "All bachelors are unmarried men"
- 

### Experience - Empiricism
- A posteriori (after experience, based on experience)
- Not necessarily true, they only happen to be true
-
