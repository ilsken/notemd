> The study of knowledge. Concerned with answering questions having to do with knowledge.
> Concerned with the "how"

- Is knowledge possible?
- If so, how can we have it?
- Is there a difference between knowledge and belief?


## Skepticism 
> Belief that we can know nothing (to varying degrees)

- Total skepticism is the belief that we can know absolutely nothing (in any field) 
- Knowledge is absolute certainty


## Pyrrho
- If knowledge was possible, it would have to come through one of two possible sources
	- Reason 
		- Enlisted in the service of supporting supporting mutually incompatible issues
		- Self neutralizing and inconclusive
	- Sense Perception / Experience 
		- In order to see that your perception is accurate you'd have to be able to get outside your perception of the world
- Neither is capable of supplying knowledge

## Cratylus
- Knowledge must be impossible because in order to know something it must never change, but everything changes
