- Accepts Pythagoras' claim that there is a distinction between form and matter
- Accepts form is superior to matter
- Agrees knowledge is always knowledge of forms
- Forms must be known by way of reason
- Knowledge must come from reason
- Rationalist
- Everything in this world changes, but this world is not exhaustive of reality
- Concepts such as beauty are objective, not in the eye of the beholder
- You must have knowledge of an item to recognize items of that kind
- Every human being has a rational capacity
- "Other World" does not exist in a physical way 
- We are souls, body's are only the matter that we inhabit
- Knowledge of the universals is within each of us
- Knowledge is innate something with which we're born
- Once we take on bodies we forget our knowledge 
- Learning isn't a process of gaining new information, but recollecting/remembering the knowledge that we have forgotten
- Universals never change


## Sensible Particulars
- Mutable, perishable, corruptible
- Time-bound, temporal
- Material
- Belief/Opinion, not knowledge


## Intelligible Universals
- Beauty (you can show examples of particulars, but can't say what the actual thing is)
- Intelligible
- Immutable
- Eternal idea, non-temporal

> Form (Class, Objective) -> Particular (Instance, Subjective)

```javascript
// Form
function Hummanity () { }
var human = new Hummanity() // Particular
```

## Metaphysics
> Study of what's real (study of reality)
