> To be is to be perceived

- 18th century bishop
- Empiricist (knowledge comes primarily from experience)
- It's because what we know are ideas or perceptions that we can't know matter
- We can't know material substance because there is no such thing as material substance
- Attempted to close the gap between perception and reality 
- All senses are perceptions and in the mind (kicking a rock is touch)
- Matter is the opposite of mind 

## Argument for God
- He knows he is a mental being
- He knows that minds have power power
- Most his perceptions are not caused by his own mind, so they must of been caused by a mind greater than his
