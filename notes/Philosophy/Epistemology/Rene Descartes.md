- There can not be two supreme beings because they'd both have to be perfect, and a perfect being can not lack anything
- If Descartes can't prove the existence of God, his whole project collapses because he can not prove anything besides his own existence
-  Reason lays down two self-evident principles
	- Something can't come from nothing
	- An affect can not be greater than it's cause
- A perfect being does not search for truth, so he could not of produced the idea of god
