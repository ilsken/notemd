- 515-430 BC
- Change is the appearance, permanence is reality
- The world is one whole, there is no change

### Three Possibilities
Possibility         | Description
--------------------|-------------
It is               | Permanence (no changes)
It is not           | Inconceivable, you can not speak about that which does 					   not exist
It is and it is not | Impossible (an object can not exist and not exist at the same time)

- Disciple of Parmedides
- Tortoise and the Hare 

** Dichotomy paradox **
If you are traveling from point A to point B you keep halving your distance as your approach your destination. Numbers can be halved forever, so to travel from A to be you must of traversed infinity. Therefore, travel/motion should be impossible

** Tortoise and the Hare **
If the tortoise can get the first step before the hare, then the hare should never be able to beat him. By the same the hare takes his first step, the tortoise should be on his second step
