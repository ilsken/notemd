- Tribalism in in our DNA
- Us against them is the simplest and quickest bonding agent
- Race, creed, or religion are the main causes of htis

- Race causes people to look out for their own kind (world not neatly divided, 337)
- Relgion tension between countries (Akbar, not neatly divided, 319)
- Non-nuclear family tribalism bad for immigration (world not neatly divided, 337)
- Cultural differences cause problems (latina women) for women being taken seriously/being harrassed

- Iraq, soviets, etc (right road to america, 337)
- Fall of rome, beocming a lose confederition of cultural political groups (right road, 336)
