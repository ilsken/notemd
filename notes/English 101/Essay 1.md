>> Do you agree with the statement "Reading will set you free"

## Thesis
> Reading and knowledge are the keys to escaping the prison created by our enviorment and those around us

### Learning to read and write (Frederick Douglass)
- Knowledge allowed him to escape the perception prison slavery had thrown him in
- Understanding the world around him caused him to further persue literal freedom
- Without understanding you are a slave to your enviorment and situation
- The more knowledgable you are the more you can shape the reality of others, and escape the ones created for you
- Quote about abolitionists in newspaper
- Quote about envying the ignorance of his peers

### Superman and Me
- His enviorment was crafted by the world around him (indians aren't good at reading/writing/anything not strictly to do with native american culture)
- Learning to read/write broke these perceptions and led him to a carrear both on and off the reservation
- The thirst for knowledge is addictive, and so in freeing himself he influenced the children he visited at schools to break free of their perceptional prison as well
- "I am trying to save our lives" quote

### The Lonley Good Company of Books
- His prison was created by his parents and teachers, that reading wasn't for fun 
- As he read he came to enjoy many reading as a recreational activity
- Gained new perspective by reading the perspectives of others
