## Relation
> a set of ordered pairs

## Domain
> set of all first elements in the ordered pair

## Range
> set of all second elements in the ordered pairs

When defining a domain and range use a bracket to define inclusive ranges and parenthesis to define exclusive ranges
- Open circle means that point is not included
## Function
> Relation where the **first** element in the ordered pair corresponds with __exactly one__ second element


## Vertical Line Test
> If no vertical line can be drawn so that it intersects a graph more than once, the graph is a function. If the line can be drawn, the graph is not a function

## Function Notation
$[f(x) = 3x + 2]
$[f(2) = 4x + 3]
$[f(2) = 4(2) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11]
$[f(2) = 11]

## Examples
> $[(a, 3)(c, 3)(e, 1)]
> $["Domain" =  {a,c,e}]
> $["Range" = {1, 3}]

&nbsp;
> $[{(-2,5), (2, 7), (-3, 5), (-3, 5), (9, 9)}] (*Function*)
> 
> $[{(-4, 3), (8, 3), (5, 2), (0, -2)}] (*Not a function*)

> $["Domain" = \[-3, -5\]]
> $["Range" = \[-2, 4\]]

> $["Domain" = (-\infinity, \in)]
> $["Range" = (0, \infinite)]
