### Summary
-----------
You can use the quadratic formula when dealing with any quadratic, linear equations. It's essentially a shortcut to [completing the square][1]

### Formula
------------
$[x_(1,2) = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 -4ac)) / (2a)][]

### Usage
-----------

- Equation is $[ax^2 + bx + c = 0]
- Equation is not a [perfect square][2]
- Equation can not be easily [solved by factoring][3]
- You need to find the values of $[x]

**Important: ** The equation _must_ be set to 0

### Example
-------------
Using the quadratic formula, the roots of $[x^2-6x+4=0] are

$[x = (-6 +- sqrt((-6)^2 - 4 (1)(4)))/(2 xx 1)]

$[\ \ = (-6 +- sqrt(36 - 16))/2] 

$[\ \ =(-6 +- sqrt(20))/2] 

$[\ \ = -0.8 or 2.2 \ \ \ ] to 1 decimal place.
