	Marlton and Cherry Hill show very similiar trends in terms of demographics, especially when it comes to age and gender. Both towns consist of families with young children with a signifigant drop in population in the late teen to young adult age range. It's implied that many parents move here to raise thier children and they move soon before or just after starting college. It would be advatageous to encourage more people in this age range to stay around and work locally, stimulating the local economy. These trends may indicate a shortage of entry level jobs and affordable housing in the area. On the otherhand, these trends ensure that mostly self-sustaining individuals with relatively well paying jobs live in these towns, which positively effects the community.
