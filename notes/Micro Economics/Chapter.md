- Why the MRP curve is it's labor demand curve
- The factors that increase or decrease labor demand
- The determinants of elasticity of labor
- How wages are determine din competitive and monopolistic labor markets
- How unions increase wage rates
- The major causes of wage differentials

## Labor Demand
- Labor is most important used by firms
- Labor demand is a derived demand, depends on:
  - productivity of the labor
  - the price of the good or service it helps produce
  - Demand for the good or service

### Marginal Revenue Product
> the change in a terms total revenue when it employs one more labor unit

$[MRP = "Change in total revenue"/"Unit change in labor"]

### Marginal Resource Cost
> change in a firm's total cost when it employs one more unit of labor

$[MRC = "Change in total (labor) cost" / "Unit change in labor"]

### Market Demand for Labor
The Labor Demand Curve can shift for three reasons
- Changes in product demand
- Changes in productivity
- Changes in prices of other resources



### Elasticity of Labor Demand
$[E_w = "Percentage change in labor quantity demanded" / "Percentage change in wage rage"]

#### Changing in the demand for labor
- Ease of resource substitutability
- Elasticity of product demand

#### What happens if labor and capital are substitutes?
- Substitution effect - cheaper machinery will be used instead of labor
- Output effect - cost of machinery decreases before the TC decreases, demand for labor increases
- Net Effect - Substitution effect vs the Output effect
  - S > O decreases labor, O > S increases labor

## Supply of labor
- Comes from all the household
- Labor leisure trade off
- 24 hours per day for work or play
- Opportunity cost is the trade off

## Monopsony Power
- Maximize profit by hiring the smaller number of workers
- Examples monopsony power
  - Nurses
  - Professional atheletes
  - Teachers
  - Unions
