### Direct and Inverse Relationships
- Direct Relationship
	- Both variables move up or down together
- Inverse Realtionship
	- Variables move opposite of each other

#### Independent Variable
> The variable causing a change, also called the causual variable

#### Dependent Variable
> The variable that changes


#### Slope of a line
- Positive slope of a straight line
	$["Slope" = "Vertical Change"/"Horizontal Change" = (+50)/(+100) = 1/2 = 0.5]

- Negative slope of a line
	*fix this*
	$["Slope" = "Vertical Change"/"Horizontal Change" = (-4)/(+100) = 1/2 = 0.5]

### Slope of a Nonlinear Curve
- Slope always changes
- Must use a line tangent to the curve to find slope
