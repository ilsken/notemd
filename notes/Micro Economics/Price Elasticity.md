## Price elasticity of demand
- Measures buyers responsiveness to price changes
- Elastic demand
	- Sensitive to price changes
	- Large change in quanity demanded
- Inelastic demand
	- Insensitive to price changes
	- Small change in quanity demanded

## Price Elasticity Coefficient Formula
$[E_d = "Percent change in quanity demanded of product X" / "Percentage change in the "]

- Calculate the percentage change
- Restate formula
	- $4 to $5 = 25% increase
	- $5 to $4 = $20% increase

$[E_d = ("Change in quanity demanded of X" / "Original quanity demanded of X" ) / ("Change in Price of X" / "Original Price of X")]

## Midpoint Formula

$[E_d = "Change in quanity" / ("Sum of the quanities / 2") "/" "Change in price" / ("Sum of prices / 2")]

## Interpretation of Elasticity of Demand
- $[E_d > 1: "demand is elastic"]
- $[E_d = 1: "demand unit is elastic"]
- $[E_d < 1: "demand is inelastic"]
- Extreme cases
	- Perfectly inelastic
	- Perfectly Elastic

## Total Revenue Test
- $["Total Revenue = Price * Quanity"]
- Inelastic demand
	- Price and Taotal Revenue move the same direction
- Elastic demand
	- Price and Taotal Revenue move in the opposite direction

## Determinant of Elasticity of Demand
- Substitability
	- More substitutes, demand is more elastic
- Proportion of income
	- Higher proportion of income, demand is more elastic
- Luxuries versus necessities
- Time
	- More time available, demand is more elastic
