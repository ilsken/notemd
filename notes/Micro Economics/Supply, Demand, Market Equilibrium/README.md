## Markets
- Interactions between buyers and sellers
- Markets may be
- Local (Wegmans, Shoprite)
- National (AT&T, Verizon)
- International (HM and Honda)

## Demand
- Schedule or curve
- Amount consumers are willing and able to purchase at a given price
- Other things equal
- Individual demand
- Market Demand

## Law of Demand
- Other things equal, as price falls, the quantity demanded rises, and as the price rises, the quantity demanded falls
- Reasons:
	- Common sense
	- Law of diminishing marginal utility
	- Income effect and substitution effects

## Demand Curve
Price | Quantity Demanded
------|-------:
$5.00|10
$4.00|20
$3.00|35
$2.00|55
$1.00|80

# Changes in Demand
- Change in consumers tastes and preferences
- Change in the number of buyers
- Changes in income
	- Normal goods
	- Inferior goods
- Change in prices of related goods
	- Complements (hot dogs, hot dog buns)
	- Substitutes 

- Changes in consumers expectations
	- Future prices
	- Future income

## Changes in Quantity Demanded
- Change in the quantity demanded is a movement from one points to another point on a fixed demand curve

## Supply
- Scheduled or curve
- The amount of producers are willing and able to sell at a given price and time
- Individual supply
- Market supply

## Law of Supply
- Other things equal, as price rises, the quantity supplied rises and as the price falls, the quantity supplied falls
- Reason:
	- Price actions as an incentive to producers
		- Greater profit
- At some point, costs will rise
- Producers must be willing to accept price


## Determinants of Supply
- A change in resource prices
	- Labor, Equipment, Raw Materials
- A change in technology
- A change in the number of sellers
- A change in the sumber of sellers
- A change in the taxes and subsidies
- A change in prices of other goods
- A change in producers expectations

## Supply Curve
- Change in supply is a shift in the supply curve

## Market Equlibrium
- Occurs where the demand curve and the supply curve intersect
- Surplus and shortage
- Rationing function of prices
	- Competive forces
- Efficient forces
	- Productive efficiency
	- Allocative efficiency ($[P=MC])

## Government-Set Pries
- Price ceilings
	- Set below eqilibrium price
	- Good sare considered necessities
- Problem
	- Rationing
	- Black markets
- Example: Rent Control
- Distorts the efficient of allocation of resources

- Price floors
	- Prices are set above the market price
	- Chronic surpluses
- Example: Minimum wage laws
- Distorts the efficient allocation of resources

- What's more important, demand or supply?

- How do supply and demand shifts affect a market?
	- Increase in supply, decrease in price
	- Increase in demand, increase in price
