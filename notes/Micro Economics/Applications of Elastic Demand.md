### Applications of Elastic Demand
- College tuition
- Large crop yields
	- Inelastic demand, lower total revenue
- Excise taxes
	- Inelastic demand, more total revenue
- Decriminalization of illegal drus
	- Inelastic dmeand, more total revenue

## Price Elasticity of Supply
- Measures seller' responsiveness to price changes

- Formula to computer elasticity
- $[E_s > 1 : "supply is elastic"]
- $[E_s < 1 : "supply is inelastic"]

- Time is the primary determinant of elasticity of supply
- Time periods considered
	- Market (now) - Perfectly inelastic
	- Short run - more elastic
	- Long run - even more elastic

## Applications of Elasticity of Supply
- Antiques
	- Inelastic supply
	- One of a kind
- Reproductions
	- More elastic supply
	- Additional supply

## Income Elasticity of Demand
$[E_i = "Percentage change in quanity demanded"/ "Percent change income"]

## Income Elasticity Insights
- High income elasticity
	- Most effected by recession
	- Movie tickets, luxury vacations
- Low or negative elasticity
	- Least affected by a recession

## Cross Elastacity
- Measures responsivess of sales to change in price of another good
- Subsitues, positive sign
- Complements negative sign
- Independent - zero

$[E_(x,y) = "Percentage in quanity demanded of product X" / "Percentage change in price of product Y"]
